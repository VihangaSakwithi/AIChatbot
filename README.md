This project is about developing an AI chatbot using Python and the Chatterbot library. The chatbot is designed to integrate with a home-based marketplace Django project, where home people can find workers for their home repairs and needs. The chatbot can interact with the users in a natural and engaging way, answering their queries, providing suggestions, and facilitating transactions. The chatbot uses the Chatterbot library, which is a framework for building conversational agents based on machine learning and natural language processing. The chatbot can also be customized to suit different domains and languages.
